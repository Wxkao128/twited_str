# twited_str
twisted structure generator, the resulting files are in the TBSc2C directory

# Two different ways to generate structures
For the case user want to define the new z-components of structures \
modules: \
lattice.py, utils.py \
example: \
test1.py, test2.py

For the case user want to use the default z-components in POSCAR \
modules: \
lattice2.py, utils2.py \
example: \
test3.py, test4.py

Plot PROCAR:
A script to read and plot decomposed band structure and comparing with original band structure
